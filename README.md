 1.1BACKGROUND INFORMATION
The traditional system of agriculture has various problems and inefficiencies that lead to low crop yields while still maintaining high production costs. Inefficient use of resources such as fertilizers, pesticides, and energy can contribute to higher production costs and environmental degradation. Traditional farming practices may not always optimize the timing and quantity of resource application, leading to waste and negative ecological impacts. Artificial intelligence can be of help in the following ways. AI algorithms integrate with weather data to provide accurate and localized forecasts. This allows farmers to plan planting and harvesting times more effectively. Machine learning models analyze historical data, current conditions, and various parameters to predict crop yields, enabling farmers to optimize resource allocation and make informed decisions. AI is used to analyze data from soil moisture sensors and other environmental sensors to optimize irrigation schedules. This reduces water wastage and ensures that crops receive the right amount of water, improving water-use efficiency. Machine learning algorithms analyze data to optimize the application of fertilizers and pesticides, reducing input costs and minimizing environmental impact.AI-powered platforms integrate data from various sources, providing farmers with actionable insights for better decision-making. This includes recommendations on planting, harvesting, and resource allocation. This are some of the applications that have been thought of by various individuals but most of them are not yet functional and have not been implemented. The aim of our project is to actualize most if not all of these great thoughts.
1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM
Traditional farming practices face several challenges, including climate variability, soil health degradation, inefficient water management, pest and disease threats, technological gaps, and labor-intensive processes. These challenges contribute to suboptimal crop yields, increased production costs, and environmental sustainability concerns. The gap lies in the need for innovative, data-driven solutions to overcome these challenges and optimize agricultural processes for enhanced productivity, resource efficiency, and economic viability. Traditional farming methods often lack the precision and data-driven decision-making required to optimize resource allocation, crop management, and overall farm efficiency. This leads to suboptimal yields and higher production costs. The inefficient use of resources, including water, fertilizers, and pesticides, contributes to increased production costs and environmental degradation. Traditional methods may not adequately address the need for precise resource management tailored to specific crop requirements. Climate variability and environmental challenges pose significant threats to crop health and yield stability. The gap lies in the development of adaptive and resilient farming practices that leverage AI to mitigate the impact of changing climate conditions and promote sustainable agriculture. Many farms, particularly small-scale and resource-constrained operations, may lack access to modern technologies. The gap is evident in the underutilization of AI, remote sensing, and precision agriculture tools that could significantly improve farm efficiency and productivity.


1.3 OBJECTIVES
Implementing AI for precision agriculture allows for precise monitoring and management of crop fields. This involves using sensors, satellite imagery, and other data sources to analyze variations in soil health, moisture levels, and crop conditions. AI can then provide recommendations for optimized resource usage, such as water, fertilizers, and pesticides, leading to improved crop yields.
Use of AI algorithms to analyze historical and real-time data to predict crop diseases, pest infestations, and weather patterns. This predictive capability enables farmers to take proactive measures to protect crops, optimize planting and harvesting schedules, and minimize losses.
The AI aims to enable farmers to make data-driven decisions by processing and analyzing vast amounts of information. This includes historical data and weather patterns. Informed decision-making contributes to better resource utilization, improved crop management, and ultimately higher yields.
1.4 RELEVANCE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT
The relevance of the project is that:
Leads to a more efficient use of resources, improved productivity, and reduced waste.  This is through its application in collecting data on which type and precise amount of water and fertilizers is needed by plants for high yields.
Provides farmers with decision support systems that analyze complex data sets such as the temperature of a place, light intensity and amount of water in the soil to recommend the best courses of action. This can include advice on crop rotation, soil health management, and optimal planting times, contributing to increased productivity.
AI enables farmers to use precision farming techniques by analyzing data from various sources such as sensors, satellites, and drones. This data helps optimize irrigation, fertilization, and pesticide application, ensuring that resources are used efficiently and minimizing waste.


1.5LIMITATIONS
Data Quality and Availability: AI relies heavily on data, and the quality and availability of agricultural data can be inconsistent. In some regions, farmers may lack access to reliable and comprehensive data, hindering the effectiveness of AI applications.
The artificial intelligence programs required higher and better knowledge in coding and implementation of better machine learning programs.
The materials provided by the arduino kit are not standard since they are only meant to give an overview of the original design hence this can lead to inaccurate data.
The cost of certain materials such as the water pump which was part of the materials was high hence the materials were not implemented instead a water sensor was used in the place of the water pump.
The arduino kit in use lacked a standard light sensor and so we had to use an infrared light sensor for collection of our data.
1.6ASSUMPTIONS MADE
 Environmental conditions, such as weather patterns, remain relatively stable over time. This is because climate change and unpredictable weather events can impact the effectiveness of AI models. Adaptability to changing conditions is essential for long-term success.
Agricultural practices are relatively uniform across regions, allowing for the development of generalizable AI models. This is because different regions may have distinct farming methods, crop varieties, and environmental conditions. Customization of AI models is often necessary to account for this diversity. While the system we have created is generalized.
